They lived for some years in North Carolina and thence removed to Bledsoe county, Tennessee, about the year 1803.

Mrs. Martha (Smith) Walker departed this life August 13, 1823, after which Mr. Walker married a second time. The descendants by his first wife located in Monroe county, Indiana, and those by the second located near South English, Iowa. He lived in Tennessee until 1857. but in the meantime his children had removed to Indiana and Iowa, and in the fall of that year he started west to Iowa. On account of the severe weather, however, he remained with the family then living in Monroe county, Indiana, and during that winter met with an accident which on account of his advanced age occasioned his death, so that he passed away in Monroe county, August 16. 1859, at the advanced age of eighty-nine years."

He left his eastern home in Bedford county, Pennsylvania, in 1810, for the West, reaching Licking county in the fall of that year, expecting to continue on to Franklin county, but discouraging reports induced him to stop. He was informed that Zanesville, some sixty miles distant from his prospective home, would be the nearest point at which to obtain salt and get his grinding done; also that the proposed location was unhealthy. This piece of news prevailed with him, and he resolved to settle closer to Zanesville. He was directed by a Mr. Wolford to this township. In the spring of 1811 he moved here, entering the northwest quarter of section 18. For six months he lived in a three-sided cabin, the one end being entirely open, but by fall he had a substantial log cabin ready for occupation. He brought with him six cows, and made a large amount of butter. Few of the settlers who soon after located here were fortunate enough to own a cow, and butter, with them, was quite a luxury. Mr. Haines availed himself of every opportunity to exchange this product of the dairy for a pig. In the course of several years he had a large drove of hogs and a fine herd of cattle, which had been raised with trifling cost. These he drove to Zanesville in several lots, and sold them at a fair figure. With the proceeds of these sales he paid for his quarter section. He reared a family of eight children, and died in 1863, at the age of eighty-one years. His brother John came with him, and settled the northwest quarter of section 14.",

            "The life of Samuel Hains was worthy of emulation, and the example he set the younger generation of the various communities where his lot was cast has doubtless resulted in much good. He was regarded as one of the most liberal men of Greene county, Indiana, although he was never blessed with an abundance of this world's goods, but he was always ready to help the needy or assist in any worthy cause. He was seriously handicapped during the later part of his life by a wound which was inflicted during the Civil war, yet he continued his work in a successful manner in the face of all obstacles, having been a man of unusual fortitude. He was born in Coshocton county, Ohio, July 8. 1832, and died in Bloomfield, Indiana, November 14, 1906. He was the son of Daniel and Sarah (Foster) Hains, the former a native of Virginia. They settled in Ohio, where Daniel farmed and lived until his death. Both he and his wife were members of the church. They had the following children : Henry, deceased ; Samuel ; Hiram, deceased; Mary, deceased; Hannah; William, who lives in Bloomfield, Indiana, and Nancy. Samuel Hains was reared on a farm, receiving his education in the pioneer schools, remaining at home until he enlisted at the outbreak of the war in the Ninety-seventh Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Company H, in which he served two and one-half years, during which time he participated in all the battles in which his regiment was engaged until he was shot in the right elbow during the battle of Missionary Ridge, which prevented further service. He had many narrow escapes from death during his army career. Returning from the army he assisted his father-in- law on the farm, but he had learned the blacksmith's trade prior to the war and in 1866 opened a shop near his old home in Coshocton county, Ohio, which he con- ducted until 1869, when he came to Greene county, Indiana, where he opened a blacksmith shop in Taylor township, which he conducted until the spring of 1875. when he moved to Bloomfield. Soon afterward he opened a shop, which he successfully maintained, having been a fine workman, until his health failed and he retired, having been in partnership with Hoyt Nickerson from 1875 until his death. He and his wife were both members of the Methodist Episcopal church. He was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and a Republican in political belief. "

And in 1723, Willem's family began their migration to the Delaware Valley.From Bergen county in East New Jersey, the family first migrated up the Hudson to the Dutch settlement at Kingston NY, arriving by 3/1723. And from Kingston, the DeVoor family migrated in the company of other ethnic Dutch families south on the Old Mine Road to the Delaware Valley, settling in the vicinity of Paulins Kill, Hunterdon (now Sussex) Co NJ by 9/1724 when his father drew up his will.After arriving in West New Jersey, Willem did not necessarily move, but the administrative boundaries did; as Morris Co split from Hunterdon Co NJ in 1739. Willem is next found in 1740 in Morris Co NJ where he and brother David were indentured to Lewis Morris, the Governor of New Jersey.On 6/13/1740 in Morris Co NJ, Willem married Catherine Schoonmaker ch. 9/11/1709 in Kingston, Ulster Co NY. And in 1753, Sussex Co split from Morris Co NJ. Catherine and Willem lived in Minisink, Sussex Co NJ until about 1772 when they migrated to Lancaster (now Bedford) Co PA.By 1772 their route would have been rather straightforward. From the Delaware Valley, they had the choice of traveling south to Philadelphia and then west or traveling west to the Susquehanna and then south to the Germantown Pike. Either way, after crossing the river at Harris Ferry, the families traveled west on the old military road, Forbes Road, to what had been Ft. Raystown, now known as Bedford PA.A William Devore is found enumerated in the 1784 and 1796 Bedford Co PA Censuses. Did Willem and Catherine live all the way into the 1790s? As Willem is not enumerated in the 1790 Census, 1790 probably marks Willem's date of death which would have been sometime prior to the census.
