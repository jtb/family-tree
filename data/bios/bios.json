On account of the severe weather, however, he remained with the family then living in Monroe county, Indiana, and during that winter met with an accident which on account of his advanced age occasioned his death, so that he passed away in Monroe county, August 16. 1859, at the advanced age of eighty-nine years."

      "Mr. Alter was born in Coblenz, Germany, April 9, 1832. In his veins there flowed the blood of two of Germany's noble families. His father was a scion of the ancient and honorable house of Von Alter, while his mother, nee Von Kutzleben, could trace her lineage back into the misty times of the age of chivalry. Born under such fortuitous circumstances, he enjoyed the best of educational facilities. A few years after the death of his father, which occurred in 1847, he emigrated, with his mother and sister to America, which to him, was the land where the true form of free government was realized. After a few month's stay in Buffalo, he came, together with the aforementioned, to Manitowoc, in May, 1850. Thus it will be seen that he was one of our oldest settlers. With the exception of a few months, spent as a clerk in Milwaukee, he has lived here ever since. He has been engaged in various enterprises and business, and during the past seven or eight years has been in charge of the Clothing Department of J. Schuette and Bros."

He left his eastern home in Bedford county, Pennsylvania, in 1810, for the West, reaching Licking county in the fall of that year, expecting to continue on to Franklin county, but discouraging reports induced him to stop. He was informed that Zanesville, some sixty miles distant from his prospective home, would be the nearest point at which to obtain salt and get his grinding done; also that the proposed location was unhealthy. This piece of news prevailed with him, and he resolved to settle closer to Zanesville. He was directed by a Mr. Wolford to this township. In the spring of 1811 he moved here, entering the northwest quarter of section 18. For six months he lived in a three-sided cabin, the one end being entirely open, but by fall he had a substantial log cabin ready for occupation. He brought with him six cows, and made a large amount of butter. Few of the settlers who soon after located here were fortunate enough to own a cow, and butter, with them, was quite a luxury. Mr. Haines availed himself of every opportunity to exchange this product of the dairy for a pig. In the course of several years he had a large drove of hogs and a fine herd of cattle, which had been raised with trifling cost. These he drove to Zanesville in several lots, and sold them at a fair figure. With the proceeds of these sales he paid for his quarter section. He reared a family of eight children, and died in 1863, at the age of eighty-one years. His brother John came with him, and settled the northwest quarter of section 14.",

      "The life of Samuel Hains was worthy of emulation, and the example he set the younger generation of the various communities where his lot was cast has doubtless resulted in much good. He was regarded as one of the most liberal men of Greene county, Indiana, although he was never blessed with an abundance of this world's goods, but he was always ready to help the needy or assist in any worthy cause. He was seriously handicapped during the later part of his life by a wound which was inflicted during the Civil war, yet he continued his work in a successful manner in the face of all obstacles, having been a man of unusual fortitude. He was born in Coshocton county, Ohio, July 8. 1832, and died in Bloomfield, Indiana, November 14, 1906. He was the son of Daniel and Sarah (Foster) Hains, the former a native of Virginia. They settled in Ohio, where Daniel farmed and lived until his death. Both he and his wife were members of the church. They had the following children : Henry, deceased ; Samuel ; Hiram, deceased; Mary, deceased; Hannah; William, who lives in Bloomfield, Indiana, and Nancy. Samuel Hains was reared on a farm, receiving his education in the pioneer schools, remaining at home until he enlisted at the outbreak of the war in the Ninety-seventh Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Company H, in which he served two and one-half years, during which time he participated in all the battles in which his regiment was engaged until he was shot in the right elbow during the battle of Missionary Ridge, which prevented further service. He had many narrow escapes from death during his army career. Returning from the army he assisted his father-in- law on the farm, but he had learned the blacksmith's trade prior to the war and in 1866 opened a shop near his old home in Coshocton county, Ohio, which he con- ducted until 1869, when he came to Greene county, Indiana, where he opened a blacksmith shop in Taylor township, which he conducted until the spring of 1875. when he moved to Bloomfield. Soon afterward he opened a shop, which he successfully maintained, having been a fine workman, until his health failed and he retired, having been in partnership with Hoyt Nickerson from 1875 until his death. He and his wife were both members of the Methodist Episcopal church. He was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and a Republican in political belief. "

A Catrina, daughter of Hendrick Schoonmaker was christened in the Dutch Reformed Church of Ulster Co NY. However, the mother is listed as Geertruy de Wit. If the mother's name was changed at transcription, then this can be Catherine's baptismal record.",
      "Catherine was born before 1711, the year of Willem DeVoor's birth; as she is listed as 'spinster' in their New Jersey application for marriage. Additionally, Jacob Rutse/Rutsz was a witness for Catherine and sister Zara's christening.",
      "On 6/13/1740 in Morris (now Sussex) Co NJ, Catherine married Willem DeVoor b. 11/6/1711 New York NY. Catherine and Willem lived in Minisink until about 1778 when they migrated to Bedford Co PA.",
      "A William Devore is found enumerated in the 1784 and 1796 Bedford Co PA Censuses. Did Willem and Catherine live all the way into the 1790s? As Willem is not enumerated in the 1790 Census, 1790 probably marks Willem's date of death sometime prior. Willem and Catherine are believed to have died, dates unknown, in Bedford Co PA."

Bedford county wasn't formed until 1771, and there wasn't a local Lutheran church until 11/1805. We know that residents of Willis Creek had to periodically run south to the protection of Ft. Cumberland to evade Indian depredations. Reasonable conjecture leads to the belief that the Lybarger family commuted back to Maryland to attend a Lutheran church where births, deaths, and baptisms were registered.",

However, the Lybarger families of Madley were removed from their initial burial sites and re-interred 11/11/1927 in Lybarger Lutheran Church Cemetery, Madley PA."

The question is \"How far did they go?\" Was the original Lybarger settlement north of the Pennsylvania line or just north of Ft. Cumberland, still within the boundaries of the Maryland Colony? As there was no civil government north of the Pennsylvania line and considering the dearth of records, let us claim Maryland.",

In 1867 conditions began to improve; with the passage of the Homestead Act, more settlers came and more land was broken up. In 1868, Henry's father had two wagons made at Brownville by a man named Helmer, and Diedrich, John, Henry E., Herman and Christian began freighting. The trips were long and difficult fraught with dangers. They once lost all but one oxen to the Indians, and barely escaped becoming involved in the Beecher Island fight, passing by it within a few miles on their way home. The trips averaged 5 weeks, but one lasted 6 months. They arrived home Xmas eve after being given up for dead. When the railroad line from Denver to Omaha was completed, their freighting days ended."

She and her two sons crossed the Atlantic in 1857, and landed in New York on July 4th, having been seven weeks and three days on the ocean. The reason why Anna brought her two sons to America ten years after her husband's death is based merely on heresay - in Germany there was a conscription law which stated that all males when reaching a certain age had to serve in the German army, and Anna did not wish her son John to be a part of this and supposedly this is what decided her to leave her Fatherland.",

She died in Peoria, September 30, 1898, aged eighty-three years, and strong in body and spirit to the last, having been sick only one week before she passed away."

      "Elisha E. Humphreys, one of the first settlers of Taylor Township, and a son of Uriah and Rachel Humphreys, was born in Sullivan County, Ind., in 1835, and when a mere boy came with his parents to this county, and settled where he now lives.",
      "Elisha E. was reared on a farm, and his advantages when a boy were meager, his father having died when he was but five years old, leaving his widow and children to make their own way in the world. The first money Mr. Humphreys ever made was by cutting rails at 40 cents per 100. When he was about fourteen years old he began farming, and for many years made that his occupation, and has been connected with that business up to the present time. For many years he has been engaged in buying and selling cattle to some extent, and has been very successful in acquiring this world's goods. Mr. Humphreys began life poor, having only ninety acres, but by industry and good management has now 2,600 acres of good land, and is the most extensive land owner living in Taylor Township.",
      "In 1852 he married Mary A. Dobbins, who is a native of Sangamon County, Ill. They are the parents of the following named children: Thomas, Lizzie, John A., Emma, Charles, Frank, James, Verna, Helen, Herman and William. In Masonary Mr Humphreys is a member of the Cahpter, and in politics is a Democrat - the only one of the six boys in his father's family."
